# Unity Simple Pinger

A small Unity application to have a more complex showcase of the [Unity Player Loop Profiles Plugin](https://github.com/Bristn/Unity-PlayerLoopProfiles).

## About

It's a pretty simple application, which allows you to create mutliple tabs, each with it's own ping entries. A ping entry has a few self-explanatory settings like `name`, `host` and `suffix`. Once a entry is activated, by clicking it, a HTTP ping gets send to the address defined by it's settings. This ping is equivalent to opening the same URL in your web browser.

## Download

If you want to checkout the application by yourself there are a few download options.

- Download the android app in the [app store](https://github.com/Bristn/Unity-PlayerLoopProfiles).
- Download the android app from the [releases](https://github.com/Bristn/Unity-PlayerLoopProfiles) of this repository.
- Download the windows application from the [releases](https://github.com/Bristn/Unity-PlayerLoopProfiles) of this repository. In this version certain functions like sharing files or importing tabs wont work, but the core should remain functional. It's mainly intended to showcase that the plugin should work for any platform.
